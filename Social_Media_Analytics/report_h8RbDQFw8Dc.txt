Comment: Di using apps like zomato, Flipkart, WhatsApp created a curiosity to learn in me , how the apps works like it's architecture and design it's functioning primarily ui/ux and backend,how different features work in a app like a let's take a example of basic features of our phone when we switch the flight mode on then the internet is disconnected automatically and starts automatically when it is off after the flight mode is off but other features like hotspot which is a secondary function didn't start at it's own we again have to enable it . 
I am a student of class 12 given boards already but I didn't like studying Physics and maths which is irrelevant to me for pursuing my interest instead I can learn functioning of business through bba .
Please senior guide me ❤🎉, Sentiment: Positive 😊
